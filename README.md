# oncemore node.js module

Extend the `once()` method of any `EventEmitter` to allow a single listener to be attached to multiple events.
This is designed to simplify consumption of node streams, where you need to trigger an action "when it's done" by listening to both the `'end'` and `'error'` emits, but applicable to any event emitter.

## Setup

To prepare any emitter, wrap it in `oncemore()`.

    var EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;
    var oncemore = require('oncemore');

    var emitter = oncemore(new EventEmitter());

## Usage

Basic example:

    emitter.once('end', 'error', function(err) {
      // do stuff
    });

Alternatively, if you need to know the triggered event:

    emitter.oncemore('end', 'error', 'timeout', function(type, err) {
      // do stuff
    });

### Limitations

Unlike regular `once` handlers, oncemore handlers are only designed to be removed by being triggered, and you must **not** use `removeListener(…)`. You can still use `removeAllListeners(…)`.

## Installation

    npm install oncemore

## Syntax

### emitter.once(event1[, event2[, …]]], listener)

Add a **one time** listener for the events. This listener is invoked only the next time any of the events are emitted, after which it is removed.

### emitter.oncemore(event1[, event2[, …]]], listener)

Similar to the updated `once` method, except that the first argument to the listener contains the type of the triggered event.
